# Applied Track

A place to keep thoughts that pop up about what to do in the applied track.

## Approach

- Medical assessments; in the same vain as [this cool project](http://machinemedicine.com/fingertapping/) what other assessments have a sheet with checkboxes as the 'state of the art' - could any of these benefit from an ML approach? Perhaps you could contribute another task to [ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/) that utilizes it? Here is [an example](https://healthy.io/) with urinalysis.

- Search for cool/cheap/unusual sensors - what applications do they enable?

- Excursion to industry; what interesting industries could you line up a person to talk to one afternoon and quiz about their problems?

- How might you use [OpenPCR](http://openpcr.org/) to collect an interesting dataset, [some applications here](https://www.xxpresspcr.com/all-news/the-applications-of-pcr/)

- How might you encode one information medium in another, to make an interesting application - for example [this application](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/device-lets-blind-see-with-tongues/) which allows blind people to "see" with their tounges.

- How might you use tiny wearable sensors to collect an interesting dataset, the [thumbnail UV detector](https://gizmodo.com/this-tiny-thumbnail-sensor-tells-you-when-to-get-off-th-1821710657) by L'Oreal is a great example.

- What can you [infer from a persons voice](http://www.peakprofiling.com/?lang=en)?

## Ideas

- Nutritional content from a photo of a plate of food.

- Assesment of development/improvement/delay of child gross/fine motor development from video.

- A tool for practicing delivery of a speech/talk; it gives you a score in real time as you talk - you are punished for pauses, ums and errs, missed words etc; by providing a metric to improve upon this could give a better feedback loop for improvement / could be fun.

- Biomass estimation from photo of a house plant / the tomato crop in the garden - growth can be quite insidious and hard to detect for people; by providing a metric to improve upon this could give a better feedback loop for improvement / could be fun.
