# Applied Track

A place to keep thoughts that pop up about what to do in the applied track.

## Approach

- Ask your doctor friends what problems they are working on at the moment.
- Medical assessments; in the same vain as [this cool project](http://machinemedicine.com/fingertapping/) what other assessments have a sheet with checkboxes as the 'state of the art' - could any of these benefit from an ML approach? Perhaps you could contribute another task to [ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/) that utilizes it?
- Search for cool/cheap/unusual sensors - what applications do they enable?
- Excursion to industry; what interesting industries could you line up a person to talk to one afternoon and quiz about their problems?

## Ideas

- Nutritional content from a photo of a plate of food.
- Assesment of development/improvement/delay of child gross/fine motor development from video.
- A tool for practicing delivery of a speech/talk; it gives you a score in real time as you talk - you are punished for pauses, ums and errs, missed words etc; by providing a metric to improve upon this could give a better feedback loop for improvement / could be fun.
