# [CMU masters](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/ms-curriculum.html)

This is a nice resource, the module sites have lecture notes, (recorded lectures), homeworks / practice papers and their solutions.

## Core Modules

MS students take all three Set Core courses:

### [10-701 Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/701/) OR [10-715 Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/Classes/ML10715_2015Fall/index.html)

### [36-700 Probability & Mathematical Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~siva/700/main.html) or [36-705 Intermediate Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/)

Karl Rosaen used 36-705 Intermediate Statistical Theory during his learning sabattical - from his learning log it looks like he got fairly stuck from time to time but found it very valuable.

### [10/36-702 Statistical Machine Learning](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=sml/)

This is run by Larry Wasserman - the author of 'All of statistics'.

The modules preceding this one in this list are considered prerequistes for this module.


## Optional Modules

Students take their choice of two Menu Core courses:

### [10-703 Deep Reinforcement Learning or 10-707 Topics in Deep Learning](https://katefvision.github.io/)

### [10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708/)

### [110-725 Convex Optimization0-725 Convex Optimization](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt/)

### [15-750 Algorithms or 15-853 Algorithms in the Real World](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/realworld/)

### [15-780 Graduate Artificial Intelligence](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./15780/)

### [15-826 Multimedia Databases and Data Mining](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/courses/826.S10/) or [10-805 Machine Learning with Large Datasets](http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/w/courses/index.php/Machine_Learning_with_Large_Datasets_10-605_in_Fall_2017)

### [36-752 Advanced Probability](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/spring17.shtml) OR [36-755 Advanced Statistical Theory](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~arinaldo/Teaching/36755/F16/)


### [36-707 Regression Analysis](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~brian/707/)


## Data Analysis Course (DAC)

The 12-unit Data Analysis Course focuses on applying machine learning techniques to real-world data, letting students explore how to use incomplete and imperfect data sets to gain useful results.

##Electives and Research

Students take three electives, which can be any 12-unit course from the School of Computer Science or Department of Statistics & Data Science at the 700-level or above, including additional courses from the Menu Core. Additional examples of courses of interest can be found on the Master's Electives page.
