### Interview Questions

Sounds like they have phone screen which is 100s of right/wrong 'Trivia' questions on linear algebra, probability/statistics, computer science and machine learning. Which makes sense as they likely recieve many applications from unqualified candidates and they need to thin the pack before assigning a team member that can ask better questions. After you get through the screen you do a day onsite with several interviews.

From [here](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Interview/DeepMind-Interview-Questions-E1596815.htm?countryRedirect=true) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/49rbnn/has_anyone_here_interviewed_with_deepmind_what/)

#### Research Engineer

- they ask standard questions on math, statistics, algorithms and ML

- There's quizzes in four areas followed by a software engineering interview and a conversation with a research engineering lead. 

- Python programming task about random number generation  

- Linear algebra, probability theory, statistics and cs fundamental questions  

- Please describe some technique of deepmind.

- Quiz: Mostly math/stats/ML/CS knowledge questions

- Software engineering / algorithmic question

- Technical interview with a team lead

- Can you describe a team project where you felt very productive and satisfied and one where nothing seemed to work out? 

- Questions from CS, math, ML and statistics

- Wikipedia style definitions of Describe a linked list, what is a positive definite matrix, basic calculus, what is a random variable, describe backprop, describe RL, etc. 

#### Software Engineer

- Phone screen: What does it mean to be a Turing-complete? What is mean, median and mode of a probability distribution? What's the difference between stack and heap, when would you use one and when the other? Please write function to compute Fibonacci numbers in an iterative manner? What are the things you regret in your life?

- The technical round is very hard. Make sure you have a good understanding of statistics, linear algebra and computer science. The questions were hard, but nothing you couldn't prepare for. I didn't pass in the end as there were a few too many things I couldn't answer correctly.

- Can you explain what a jacobian matrix is?
