# Machine Learning Sabattical

### Goal

Full time work as a **confident** practitioner of ML in an interesting/worthwhile domain.

- Role affords ML/data science activities:  obtaining and processing data, selecting, fitting and evaluating models.
- Role affords software engineering activities: writing business logic, performance, scale, deployment.
- Role is core to the business.
- Role permits engagement with product - not “throwing models over the wall” to a product team.

### Time

3 - 6 months full time

*< 3 months full time study not enough for good treatment of foundational material.*

*> 6 months becomes unaffordable + risks going down a rabbit hole.*


### Starting point

- 3 years professional software engineering: variety of domains/platforms/languages.
- Working maths knowledge.
- Wet feet: Andrew Ng's ML course and course 1 and 2 from Ng’s deep learning specialisation. Nielsens neural nets book + various blogs, tutorials and messing around.
