# Machine Learning Sabattical

## Goal

Full time work as confident practitioner of ML in an interesting/worthwhile/medical domain.

- Responsibility across concerns of “engineering”: writing business logic, performance, scale, deployment..
- Responsibility across concerns of “ML/data science”:  obtaining +  processing data, selecting, fitting and evaluating models.. 
- Role is core to the business.
- Role permits engagement with product
- Not an ops type role for a research team - though some of that is fine. 
- Not “throwing models over the wall” to a product team.

## Time

3 - 6 months full time

*< 3 months full time study not enough for axiomatic treatment of foundational material.*

*> 6 months becomes unaffordable + risks going down a rabbit hole.*


## Starting point

- 3 years professional software engineering; variety of domains/platforms/languages.
- Working maths knowledge, refreshed over last ~ 18 months inc. calculus and linear algebra.
- Feet are wet, Andrew Ng ML course, course 1 and 2  from Ng’s deep learning specialisation,  Nielsens neural nets book + various blogs, tutorials and tomfoolery with various tools + languages.

## Curriculum

Phase one from -  http://karlrosaen.com/ml/

## Track 1: Probability and statistics

- Stanford prob and stats MOOC
- Wasserman’s ‘All of Statistics’ Ch 1 - 5

## Track 2: Applied ML
