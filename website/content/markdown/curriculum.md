# Curriculum – Machine Learning Sabbatical

Constructed in collaboration with [a-martyn](https://github.com/a-martyn/ml-sabbatical)

## Summary

- **Time**: 3 months full-time
- **Prequesites**: Python programming, A-level / intermediate undergraduate level maths 

This curriculum aims to provide a 3-month course teaching the prerequisite mathematics and foundational principles of machine learning. We have opted for a bottom-up approach focussing on fundamental principles whilst also allowing scope for applied experimentation.

Three tracks of study are pursued in parallel: 

1. **Foundational track**: Structured course-based study of fundamental concepts that apply broadly across machine learning including mathematics, statistics and core learning algorithms.
2. **Applied track**: Goal driven projects intended to test understanding and application of knowledge, and build strong communication of machine learning concepts
3. **Interview training**: Refresh of computer science fundamentals and preparation for technical interviews

## 1. Foundational Track

#### Introduction to Machine Learning (60 hrs)

- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng

#### Maths

- Course: [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) (60 hrs)
- Textbook: [DS-GA 1002: Statistical and Mathematical Methods](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/DSGA1002_fall15/index.html) 
- [Checklist](https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Notes/prereq-questions/math-questions.pdf)
- [Cribsheet](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ml1-2008/cribsheet.pdf)

#### Supervised Learning & Statistics (90 hrs)

- Course: [Foundations of Machine Learning](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/?utm_campaign=Artificial%2BIntelligence%2BWeekly&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Artificial_Intelligence_Weekly_81#home) by Bloomberg ML EDU
- Textbooks:
    - Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow (Aurélien Géron) 
    - The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani)
    - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
    - Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms (Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David)
    - Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Murhy
    - Data Science for Business (Provost and Fawcett)

#### Unsupervised Learning / Graphical Models

- Course: TBD
- Textbook: TBD

## 2. Applied track 

- Build a dataset from scratch
- Look for problems where dataset can be built quickly
- 20% increasing to 50% of course time as knowledge progresses
- Projects should be fun, and have toy-like quality
- Focus on demonstrable deliverables (1 per week)


## 3. Interview training track

- Course: [InterviewCake.com](https://www.interviewcake.com/table-of-contents)
- Textbook: [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=QPVA208VDTCKHXASXE7M)


## Time commitments

- 60% Theoretical study
- 20% Technical interview training
- 20% Applied
- 1 Meetup / week


## Desired outcomes

- [x] Machine Learning by Andrew Ng coursera accreditation
- [ ] Mathematics for Machine Learning by Imperial College coursera accreditation
- [ ] 12 Jupyter notebooks demonstrating fundamental topics in machine learning
- [ ] At least one demonstrable project that applies ml techniques
