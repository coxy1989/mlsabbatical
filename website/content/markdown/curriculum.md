# Curriculum – Machine Learning Sabbatical

Constructed in collaboration with [a-martyn](https://github.com/a-martyn/ml-sabbatical)

## Summary

- **Time**: 3 months full-time
- **Prequesites**: Python programming, A-level / intermediate undergraduate level maths 

This curriculum aims to provide a 3-month course teaching the prerequisite mathematics and foundational principles of machine learning. We have opted for a bottom-up approach focussing on fundamental principles whilst also allowing scope for applied experimentation.

Three tracks of study are pursued in parallel: 

1. **Foundational track**: Structured course-based study of fundamental concepts that apply broadly across machine learning including mathematics, statistics and core learning algorithms.
2. **Applied track**: Goal driven projects intended to test understanding and application of knowledge, and build strong communication of machine learning concepts
3. **Practice track**: A "little and often" track; small programming exercises and mathematical problems. Intended to keep maintain and enhance practical skills.

## 1. Foundational Track

#### Introduction to Machine Learning (60 hrs)

- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng

#### Mathematics

- Course: [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) (60 hrs)
- Textbook: [DS-GA 1002: Statistical and Mathematical Methods](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/DSGA1002_fall15/index.html) 
- [Checklist](https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Notes/prereq-questions/math-questions.pdf)
- [Cribsheet](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ml1-2008/cribsheet.pdf)

#### Supervised Learning & Statistics (90 hrs)

- Course: [Foundations of Machine Learning](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/?utm_campaign=Artificial%2BIntelligence%2BWeekly&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Artificial_Intelligence_Weekly_81#home) by Bloomberg ML EDU
- Textbooks:
    - Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow (Aurélien Géron)

## 2. Applied track 

- Build a dataset from scratch
- Look for problems where dataset can be built quickly
- 20% increasing to 50% of course time as knowledge progresses
- Projects should be fun, and have toy-like quality
- Focus on demonstrable deliverables (1 per week)


## 3. Practice track
