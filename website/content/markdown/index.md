## Home

Hello, I'm [Jamie](https://github.com/coxy1989). I've created this site to track my machine learning studies, the site is statically hosted on S3 - you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/coxy1989/mlsabbatical).

### Goal

Full time work as a **confident** practitioner of ML in an interesting/worthwhile domain.

- Role affords engagement with ML/data science activities:  obtaining and processing data, selecting, fitting and evaluating models.
- Role affords engagement with software engineering activities: writing business logic, performance, scale, deployment.
- Role affords engagement with product - not “throwing models over the wall” to a product team.
- Role is core to the business.

### Time

3 Months Full-Time

### Starting point

- 3 years professional software engineering: variety of domains/platforms/languages.
- Working maths knowledge.
- ML feet are wet: I've previously completed [Andrew Ng's ML course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [course 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) and [course 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network) from Ng’s deep learning specialisation. I've worked though [Nielsen's neural nets book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) + various blogs, tutorials and [messing around](https://github.com/coxy1989/clj_mnist).
