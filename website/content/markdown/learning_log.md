## Learning Log

### Tuesday, 24/07/2018

I completed the first three weeks of the Mathematics for machine learning: Linear Algebra course. This was a nice back to basics linear algebra review, which I didn't mind as it felt good to stake out some ground - topics included:

- Dot product
- Scalar and vector projection
- Changing basis
- Linear Independence
- Matrix transformations and their composition
- Gaussian elimination
- Matrix inverses
- Determinants

I signed up for and had a poke around on [interviewcake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) to get a feel for it. I'll start a more systematic transit through the material tomorrow.

I created [a document]() to track project ideas for the applied track.

### Monday, 23/07/2018

I met up with my study buddy, we compared notes and constructed [our curriculum](https://www.coxy1989.com/curriculum.html).

### Friday, 20/07/2018

I reviewed:

- Recommender systems / low rank matrix factorization
- Batch / Mini Batch / Stocastic GD

Which concluded my review of my notes from Andrew Ng's ML course.

I reviewed the curricula from some masters courses and made notes [here](https://github.com/coxy1989/mlsabbatical/tree/master/notes)

### Thursday, 19/07/2018

I reviewed:

- K-Means
- Principal Components Analysis
- Anomaly Detection

In the afternoon I continued working through chapter 3 of "Python Machine Learning".

### Wednesday, 18/07/2018

I reviewed:

- Neural Networks
- Bias & Variance, Precsion & Recall
- SVMs

In the afternoon I started working through chapter 3 of "Python Machine Learning".

I took a look at the UCL machine learning masters syllabus and made notes [here](https://github.com/coxy1989/mlsabbatical/blob/master/notes/02-ucl-masters-curriculum.md)

### Tuesday, 17/07/2018

Revisited my notes from Andrew Ng's course and cross referenced some topics with some more advanced resources. I found the book I was a little afraid of - Bishop's PRML is challenging but well written and accessible.

I reviewed:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Overfitting & Regularisation

### Monday, 16/07/2018


Morning working on my [curriculum](https://www.coxy1989.com/curriculum.html). Activities have included:

- Reviewing Karl Rosean's [learning log](http://karlrosaen.com/ml/learning-log/) (my notes [here](https://github.com/coxy1989/mlsabbatical/blob/master/notes/01-karl-rosaen-learning-log-notes.md)) and [resources](http://karlrosaen.com/ml/)
- Scanning resources
- Writing up curriculum page and this log

I hope to get a first draft out today and solicit some feedback. 

I met up with a colleague in the afternoon. He's interested in pursuing a machine learning sabbatical of his own which is fantastic news. After talking for a few hours I'm convinced that I should take a slightly more measured approach to planning my curriculum. I'm going to take a step back and explore the space of possible curricula a little further before seeking wider feedback. I plan to systematicaly review curricula offered from masters programmes and look at the requirements on ML job listings. I'll also continue to thumb through more resources and feel out what looks promising. I'm going to meet up with said colleague early next week, we intend compare notes on what to include in what we plan on learning, we've agreed it makes sense to share a set of 'core modules' but to have the freedom to also pursue 'optional modules' so that we're not shackled to eachother and can still pursue interest.

I'm going to spend the rest of this week engaging in the following activities:

- Revisiting my notes from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.
- Cross referencing the topics is the Andrew Ng course with some of the resources I have discovered and feeling out which are suitable.
- Reviewing curricula of masters programmes.
- Exploring core and optional modules for inclusion in the curriculum.


### Sunday, 15/07/2018

A day off at Hampstead Heath. Felt out the Talking Machines Podcast, listening to the first 3 episodes.

In the first episode we were privy to a chat with: Yan LeCun, Yoshua Benugo and Geoff Hinton. I'm aware of LeCun having downloaded the MNIST dataset from [his website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) a while ago to do [clj_mnist](https://github.com/coxy1989/clj_mnist). I was also aware of Benugo as a co-author of the [deep learning bible](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618) and I've seen Hinton before in an interview with Andrew Ng in a coursera course - these guys are the Deep Learning Mafia. We also met Kevin Murphy who's a head honcho at google and the author of [Machine Learning a Probabalistic Perspective](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020) which is fighting it out with [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738) to be the canonical advanced level machine learining reference  - I'll hope to graduate onto these books in the not too distant future (I bought PRML last week for the odd flick through, to gauge how deep the pool is).

In the second episode we met Ilya Sutskever. He's an deep learning fan boy working at google. Amongst other things, he said he felt it was not well understood why it should be that gradient decent empirically appears to be an appropriate algorithm for finding good paramaters for deep NNs given the high-dimensional non-convex surface of the function they are tasked with optimizing. He linked this to the AI winter, saying that in the 80s/90s people had failed to train deep neural networks for other reasons (badly initialized weights in paticular) and incorrectly concluded that the optimisation problem posed by deep NNs was intractable. In the third episode the host dug out a relevant paper from Yoshua Bengioâ€™s Lab entitled: "Identifying and attacking the saddle point problem in high-dimensional non-convex optimization", the paper contains empirical and theoretical evidence that saddle points are more frequently the cause of slow training in large NNs than local minima, the paper also proposes some approaches for tackling this problem.

Summary

- A few people to follow on twitter to keep abreast of the moving frontier
- A couple of earmarked textbooks
- Interesting podcast, nice to get a historical context, nice technical level; not superficial but doesn't require frequent pausing / taking of notes. Will continue to listen.


### Saturday, 14/07/2018

I spun up this website and began feeling out some resources that I may decide to include in the curriculum.
