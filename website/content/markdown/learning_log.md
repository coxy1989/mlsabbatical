## Learning Log

Whipped back through the slides from the first 4 weeks of Ng's Machine Learning course and took the opportunity to cross reference some topics with some more advanced resources. I found the book I was a little afraid of - Bishop's PRML is well written and accessible. I'll continue to whip back through Ng's course and cross reference. When I'm done I'll get back to curriculum plotting, with refreshed knowledge and a better idea of the quality of the resources available in hand.

Morning working on my [curriculum](https://www.coxy1989.com/curriculum.html). Activities have included:

- Reviewing Karl Rosean's [learning log](http://karlrosaen.com/ml/learning-log/) (my notes [here](https://github.com/coxy1989/mlsabbatical/blob/master/notes/01-karl-rosaen-learning-log-notes.md)) and [resources](http://karlrosaen.com/ml/)
- Scanning resources
- Writing up curriculum page and this log

I hope to get a first draft out today and solicit some feedback. 

I met up with a colleague in the afternoon. He's interested in pursuing a machine learning sabbatical of his own which is fantastic news. After talking for a few hours I'm convinced that I should take a slightly more measured approach to planning my curriculum. I'm going to take a step back and explore the space of possible curriculae a little further before seeking wider feedback. I plan to systematicaly review curiculae offered from masters programmes and look at the requirements on ML job listings. I'll also continue to thumb through more resources and feel out what looks promising. I'm going to meet up with said colleague early next week, we intend compare notes on what to include in what we plan on learning, we've agreed it makes sense to share a set of 'core modules' but to have the freedom to also pursue 'optional modules' so that we're not shackled to eachother and can still pursue interest.

I'm going to spend the rest of this week engaging in the following activities:

- Whipping back through the Andrew Ng Machine Learning course lecture slides.
- Cross referencing the topics is the Andrew Ng course with some of the resources I have discovered and feeling out which are suitable.
- Reviewing curiculae of masters programmes
- Exploring core and optional modules for inclusion in the curriculum.

A day off at Hampstead Heath. Felt out the Talking Machines Podcast, listening to the first 3 episodes.

In the first episode we were privy to a chat with: Yan LeCun, Yoshua Benugo and Geoff Hinton. I'm aware of LeCun having downloaded the MNIST dataset from [his website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) a while ago to do [clj_mnist](https://github.com/coxy1989/clj_mnist). I was also aware of Benugo as a co-author of the [deep learning bible](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618) and I've seen Hinton before in an interview with Andrew Ng in a coursera course - these guys are the Deep Learning Mafia. We also met Kevin Murphy who's a head honcho at google and the author of [Machine Learning a Probabalistic Perspective](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020) which is fighting it out with [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738) to be the canonical advanced level machine learining reference  - I'll hope to graduate onto these books in the not too distant future (I bought PRML last week for the odd flick through, to gauge how deep the pool is).

In the second episode we met Ilya Sutskever. It was interesting hearing him talk about how he is suprised that gradient decent is an appropriate algorithm given the high-dimensional non-convex surfaces of the functions they are tasked with optimizing neural networks. He linked this to the AI winter, saying that in the 80s/90s people had failed to train deep neural networks for other reasons (badly initialized weights in paticular) and incorrectly concluded that optimizing deep NNs was not a tractable problem. In the third episode the host dug out a relevant paper from Yoshua Bengioâ€™s Lab entitled: "Identifying and attacking the saddle point problem in high-dimensional non-convex optimization", the paper contains empirical and theoretical evidence that saddle points are more frequently the cause of slow training in large NNs than local minima, the paper also proposes some approaches for tackling this problem.

Summary

- A few people to follow on twitter to keep abreast of the moving frontier
- A couple of earmarked textbooks
- Interesting podcast, nice to get a historical context, nice technical level; not superficial but doesn't require frequent pausing / taking of notes. Will continue to listen.

I spun up this website and began feeling out some resources that I may decide to include in the curriculum.
